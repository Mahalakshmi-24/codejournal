  # Why you should keep a Code Journal
      
        Journaling is often thought of as an arty or holistic pastime, 
        an activity for those with a creative streak or too much time on 
        their hands. Why would a technical person be interested in journaling?

        Journaling is a tool, and a Code Journal is a tool for anyone who
        uses technology (not just specifically code), be it in their job or
        as a hobby (developers, software architects, QA/testers, etc).
